Description: This package provides R6 classes for describing 
    functional data with embedding in various infinite-dimensional 
    Hilbert spaces. Currently, functional data classes are 
    implemented in Sobolev spaces (including the popular the L2 
    space of square-integrable functions) and in Bayes space. 
    Operators +, -, *, and / as well as inner product and induced 
    distance are implemented as well.
