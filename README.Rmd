## Overview of the `fuse` package

This package provides `R6` classes for describing functional data with embedding
in various infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Currently, functional data
classes are implemented in Sobolev spaces (including the popular the $L^2$ space of
square-integrable functions) and in Bayes space. Operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` as
well as inner product and induced distance are implemented as well.

## Installation

You can install `fusez from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astamm/fuse")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
