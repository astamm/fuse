## Overview of the `fuse` package

This package provides `R6` classes for describing functional data with
embedding in various infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Currently,
functional data classes are implemented in Sobolev spaces (including the
popular \(L^2\) space of square-integrable functions) and in Bayes
space. Operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` as well as inner product and
induced distance are implemented as well.

## Installation

You can install `fuse` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astamm/fuse")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```
